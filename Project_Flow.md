# 1.Project:Customer Churn Project:
 # Problem Statement: 
 The retail industry faces significant challenges in retaining customers due to increasing competition, evolving customer preferences, and a shift towards online shopping. Customer churn—when customers stop purchasing from a business—is a critical issue that directly impacts revenue and profitability.The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on historical data, including customer demographics, purchase behavior, and interaction patterns. By identifying customers at risk of churning, the model will enable the company to implement targeted retention strategies such as personalized offers, discounts, or improved customer service, thereby enhancing customer loyalty and maximizing long-term revenue.The solution will involve analyzing customer data, building a predictive model, and visualizing insights to support decision-making for marketing and customer relationship teams.

# 2. Data Preprocessing:
   # A. Data Cleaning:
# Handle Missing Values:
Replace missing numerical values with mean/median or use advanced imputation techniques.
For categorical data, use mode or create a separate "Unknown" category.
Remove Duplicates:
Ensure no duplicate customer entries.
Outlier Detection and Handling:
Use statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR) to detect and handle outliers in purchase amounts or frequency.
 # B. Data Transformation
Feature Encoding:
Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Example: Gender → Male: 1, Female: 0.
Feature Scaling:
Standardize numerical features (e.g., z-score normalization) for algorithms sensitive to scale like SVM.
Min-Max Scaling for features like purchase frequency and recency.
  # C. Feature Engineering
Create Derived Features:
Recency (Days since last purchase).
Frequency (Number of purchases in the last X months).
Monetary Value (Total spend in a given period).
RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value).
Customer Segmentation:
Cluster customers into groups based on behavior using techniques like K-Means Clustering.
# Aggregate Data:
Summarize transactional data at the customer level (e.g., average basket size).

# 2.Project:AI Chatbots for Retail Customer 
# Problem Statement:
  The client previously relied on a manual customer service system to respond to product 
reviews, which was time-consuming and inconsistent. This approach often led to delays in 
addressing customer feedback, missed opportunities to engage with customers, and 
inadequate resolution of concerns. To address these limitations, the client seeks an 
automated solution to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.
# Objective:
To develop a Generative AI-powered chatbot that automatically responds to product 
reviews in real time, leveraging customer feedback data such as review sentiments (positive,
negative, neutral), product ratings, common issues, and FAQs. The chatbot aims to deliver 
personalized, timely responses that acknowledge positive feedback, resolve negative 
concerns, and address frequently raised questions, ultimately enhancing customer 
engagement and brand reputation.
 1: Install All the Required Packages-- langchain, pypdf, openai. 
2. Import All the Required Libraries – PyPDFLoader, OpenAIEmbeddings.
 3. Load the Documents and Extract Text from Them.
 Using PyPDF we will extract the text from documents.
 4. Split the Document into Chunks.
 To split a document into chunks, you need to determine the desired size for each chunk, 
whether based on words, sentences, paragraphs, or pages. Once the document is loaded, split 
the text into chunks accordingly. Optionally, perform any necessary processing on each 
chunk, such as text preprocessing or feature extraction. Finally, store or use the chunks as 
needed for further analysis or processing in your application.
 We will split the Documents into chunks using ‘CharacterTextSplitter” from ‘langchain’ to
 split the extracted text into chunks.
 After splitting the document into chunks, each chunk undergoes a series of  preprocessing
 steps, 
# Preprocessing steps:
 # 1. Removing Stop Words: 
 This involves eliminating common words such as "the," "is,"
 and "and" from the text. These words typically do not carry significant meaning and
 can be safely removed to reduce noise in the data.
 # 2. Tokenization: 
 Tokenization breaks down the text into individual words or tokens.
 This step is essential for further analysis, as it provides a structured representation of
 the text that can be processed more efficiently.
 # 3. Converting All Text to Lowercase: 
 By converting all text to lowercase, we ensure
 consistency in the data. This prevents the same words from being treated differently
 due to differences in capitalization, improving the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
 # 4. Removing URLs: 
 URLs often appear as noise in text data and do not contribute to
 the semantic meaning of the content. Removing them helps streamline the data and
 focus on relevant information.
 # 5. Removing Email Addresses:
 Similar to URLs, email addresses are typically
 irrelevant for text analysis tasks and can be safely removed to reduce clutter and
 improve focus on meaningful content.
 # 6. Converting Emojis to Text: 
 Emojis are graphical representations used to convey
 emotions or sentiments. Converting them to text equivalents ensures uniformity in the
 data and facilitates analysis by treating emojis as regular textual content.
# 7. Expanding Text Contractions: 
Text contractions such as "can't" or "won't" are
 expanded into their full forms ("cannot" and "will not," respectively) to ensure
 consistency in representation and facilitate accurate analysis.
 # 8. Lemmatization:
 Lemmatization involves reducing words to their base or dictionary
 forms (lemmas). This step helps standardize variations of words and reduces the
 vocabulary size, leading to more effective analysis.
 # 9. Removing Punctuation: 
 Punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and
 exclamation points are removed from the text. While punctuation serves grammatical
 purposes, it often does not contribute substantially to the semantic meaning of the text
 and can be safely eliminated.
 # 5. We Download the Embeddings from OpenAI Embeddings.
  We are using text Embedding 3 small as our embedding model because this
 is the basic one and our project is still in POC
 # 6. Setting Up Chroma DB for storage purposes as our Vector Database.
 Embeddings that we got above are stored in Vector Database which is
 Chroma DB
# 7. We will create an OPENAPI KEY and then we will use the OPENAPI
 KEY to access the Model, we will instruct the model by giving the
 necessary prompt 
 Here we are using chatgpt 3.5 turbo, and chatgpt4 as our models. We will do
 prompt enrichment if our answers are not correct, and we can use RAG to get
 proper and accurate answers.
 # 8)After the prompt, 
 it will convert into embeddings and then based on
 embeddings it will use semantic search and then we will check whether the
 answers are correct or not
 Here we will use a cosine similarity search to find the distance between
 words.
 # 9)We have created a memory object that is necessary to track
 inputs/outputs and hold a conversation: To create a memory object for
 monitoring inputs and outputs in your chatbot conversation.
 We follow the below steps for creating a memory object:
 1. Define Memory Structure: Determine the structure of the memory object, including 
fields to store user inputs, chatbot responses, timestamps, and any other relevant 
information.
2. Implement Memory Functionality: Write code to instantiate the memory object and 
add methods for storing user inputs and chatbot responses and retrieving conversation 
history and timestamps.
 3. Integrate Memory with Chatbot: Integrate the memory functionality into your chatbot 
application, ensuring that user inputs and chatbot responses are properly recorded and 
stored in the memory object during the conversation.
 4. Ensure Data Privacy and Security: Implement measures to ensure the privacy and 
security of the data stored in the memory object, such as encryption, access controls, 
and data anonymization.
 5. Test Memory Functionality: Test the memory functionality thoroughly to ensure that 
it accurately tracks conversation history and timestamps and that the data is stored.
